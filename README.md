Project ChARIoT: A framework for Internet of Things using Augmented Reality as user interface

Files for both Unity and Arduino are contained in this directory.
Take a look at the wiki for full project instructions.

Inspired by the LITATLAS project from Victoria University of Wellington. Find out more about LITATLAS here: http://litatlas.nz/

Special thanks to R3D* for the "Controlling an Arduino through Unity" tutorial that informed a lot of this work.
